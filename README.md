# Project Repository

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, visualization, feature selection, and regression analysis related to predicting student grades.

## Directory and File Structure

### /clean_data.py
Script for cleaning the dataset. This file handles missing values, normalizes data, and removes outliers to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

### /data_visualization.py
Script to visualize the dataset. It includes various charts and plots to understand the distribution of features and target variables, helping to identify patterns and correlations.

### /featureselectPCA.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook that performs feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This file is used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by retaining the most significant features, which can improve model performance.

### /homePage.py
Script for the main homepage interface of the project. This file may serve as the starting point for running the application, possibly using Streamlit to display results and metrics.

### /midtermCheckpoint.py
Script that documents the progress at a midterm checkpoint. This file includes code, visualizations, and metrics obtained up to that point, summarizing key findings and challenges.

### /preproc_data.py
Script for preprocessing the data. This file applies transformations, such as scaling and encoding, to prepare the data for machine learning models. This is a crucial step to ensure compatibility with algorithms used in later stages.

### /regression.ipynb
Jupyter Notebook that performs regression analysis to predict grades based on the selected features. This file includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of results for deeper insights.

### /regression.py
Python script that executes the regression model on the dataset. This file includes the same model-building steps as `regression.ipynb`, but in a streamlined Python script format for easier execution.

Each file in this repository contributes to various stages of the data analysis and machine learning workflow, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model building and evaluation.
